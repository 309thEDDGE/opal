# Note:

The two demos included in this directory are expected to be non-operable
outside of the open-internet accessible OPAL-acceptance deployment. They exist
here in the repo for two reasons:

1. They serve as a valuable demonstration of OPAL's airgapped analysis
   capabilities.
2. They serve as a servicable test of OPAL's big data packages, and are used
   to determine that OPAL's Python data tooling exists in a useful state.

Feel free to browse the code, as it may be useful in learning how to use Dask,
Metaflow, TIP, and/or Weave. Just keep in mind it probably won't function
outside of it's intended deployment.
