    "<h2>Dask Gateway</h2>\n",
    "Dask Gateway provides a secure, multi-tenant server for managing Dask clusters. It allows users to launch and use Dask clusters in a shared, centrally managed cluster environment, without requiring users to have direct access to the underlying cluster backend (e.g. Kubernetes, Hadoop/YARN, HPC Job queues, etc…).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask Gateway is one of many options for deploying Dask clusters, see Deploying Dask in the Dask documentation for an overview of additional options.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Highlights</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Centrally Managed: Administrators do the heavy lifting of configuring the Gateway, users simply connect to the Gateway to get a new cluster. Eases deployment, and allows enforcing consistent configuration across all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Secure by Default: Cluster communication is automatically encrypted with TLS. All operations are authenticated with a configurable protocol, allowing you to use what makes sense for your organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flexible: The gateway is designed to support multiple backends, and runs equally well in the cloud as on-premise. Natively supports Kubernetes, Hadoop/YARN, and HPC Job Queueing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Robust to Failure: The gateway can be restarted or experience failover without losing existing clusters. Allows for seamless upgrades and restarts without disrupting users."
